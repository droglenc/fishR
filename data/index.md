title: "Fisheries Data in R Packages"

The [**FSA**](https://github.com/droglenc/FSA) and [**FSAdata**](https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata) packages contain many data sets that may be used in typical fisheries analyses.  In fact, several of these data sets have been used in the [examples](http://derekogle.com/fishR/examples/).  All of these data sets, along with short descriptions and links to view the data, download the data, or read the meta-information documentation, can be accessed via the links below.
