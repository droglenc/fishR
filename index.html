<div class="main-explain-area jumbotron">
  <p>R is an environment for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with fisheries scientists.  The <strong>fishR</strong> website provides resources for and examples of fisheries-related analyses performed in R.  It is my hope that the resources here will inspire or motivate you to either use R or expand your knowledge of R for fisheries-related analyses.  Take a look around!!<p>
