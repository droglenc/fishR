title: "Fisheries Data in R Packages"
---

The [**FSA**](https://github.com/droglenc/FSA) and [**FSAdata**](https://github.com/droglenc/FSAdata) packages contain many data sets that may be used in typical fisheries analyses.  In fact, several of these data sets have been used on the [**fishR**](http://derekogle.com/fishR) webpage and in the [*Introductory Fisheries Analysis with R*](http://derekogle.com/IFAR) book.  All of these data sets, along with short descriptions and links to view and download the data or read the meta-information documentation, can be accessed via the links below.
