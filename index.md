</div>

[R is an environment](https://www.r-project.org/) for statistical analyses and graphics that is rapidly gaining popularity with fisheries scientists.  The **fishR** website provides resources for and examples of fisheries-related analyses performed in R.  It is my hope that the resources here will inspire or motivate you to either use R or expand your knowledge of R for fisheries-related analyses.  Take a look around!!

See [Inside-R](http://www.inside-r.org/what-is-r) and [R-project](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) for two descriptions of R.
