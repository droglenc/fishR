title: "Fisheries Data in FSA and FSAdata"

<!-- This is meant to be run with aaaCompile.R, not as a standalone -->

All fisheries-related data sets in the the `FSA` (v`r packageVersion("FSA")`) and `FSAdata` (v`r packageVersion("FSAdata")`) packages are listed below.  These data sets may be viewed with ![view](`r iview`), downloaded (as a CSV file) with ![download](`r idown`), and the meta-information documentation may be viewed with ![documentation](`r idoc`).

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
## Get all data sets in the package
res <- help.search(keyword="datasets",package=pkgs)$matches[,c("Package","Topic","Title")]
## Remove the data sets that have lit in the name (PSDlit and WSlit)
res <- res[!grepl("lit",res$Topic),]
## Sort by "Topic" (i.e., name of data set)
res <- res[order(res$Topic),]
## Make an unnumbered list of the data sets
for (j in 1:nrow(res)) {
  tmp <- paste0("* ",res[j,"Package"],"::**",res[j,"Topic"],"** -- ")
  tmp <- paste0(tmp,"[![view](",iview,")](",gh1,res[j,"Package"],gh2,res[j,"Topic"],".csv)  ")
  tmp <- paste0(tmp,"[![download](",idown,")](",rgh1,res[j,"Package"],rgh2,res[j,"Topic"],".csv)  ")
  tmp <- paste0(tmp,"[![documentation](",idoc,")](data-html/",res[j,"Topic"],".html) -- ")
  tmp <- paste0(tmp,"*",res[j,"Title"],"*\n")
  cat(tmp)
}
```
