<h2>Biological data for Lake Trout from the Arctic LTER (AK).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Biological data (lengths, weight, age, and sex) of Lake Trout (<em>Salvelinus namaycush</em>) sampled from Lake NE12 of the Arctic Long Term Ecological Research location.</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 86 observations on the following 6 variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>id: A unique identification number.</p>
</dd> 
<li>tl: Total Length (nearest mm) at capture.</p>
</dd> 
<li>fl: Fork Length (nearest mm) at capture.</li>
<li>sl: Standard Length (nearest mm) at capture.</p>
</dd> 
<li>w: Weight (nearest g) at capture.</p>
</dd> 
<li>otorad: Total otolith radius (mm) at capture.</li>
<li>age: Age (completed growing seasons) at capture.</p>
</dd> 
<li>sex: Sex of the fish (<code>F</code>=female and <code>M</code>=male).</p>
</dd> 
</ul>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Lake trout were removed from Lake NE12 in the summers of 1986, 1988, and 1989 using five-panel experimental gill nets (mesh size of 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 inches).  Lengths, weights, and sex were recorded from the fish while otoliths, and if possible, stomachs and gonads were removed for future analysis.  A check was performed on several otoliths by an independent colleague and prevents introduction of bias due to familiarity with the samples.  The original file was &ldquo;cleaned&rdquo; in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li> Only Lake Trout were kept in the data file.</li>
<li> All unknown sex fish were removed.</li>
<li> Fish with missing data (length, weight,age, or sex) were removed.</li>
<li> Decimals were removed from the ages.</li>
<li> The unique IDs for fish from 1989 were changed to start at 500.</li>
<li> The weight of fish number 509 was changed from 100 to 1100.</p>
</li></ol>
