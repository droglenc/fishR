These are vignettes fromk the original **fishR** website.  Most of these have been updated and included in the [*Introductory Fisheries Analysis with R*](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/) (IFAR) book.  Thus, these examples likely contain code that is out-of-date.  I am slowly working on updating these, you should consult the IFAR book in the meantime.  If you have questions or see code that does not work then please let me know and I will try to fix the problem immediately.  Thank you for your patience.
