<h2>Ages and lengths for a hypothetical sample from Westerheim and Ricker (1979).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ages and lengths for a hypothetical sample in Westerheim and Ricker (1979).</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame of 2369 observations on the following 3 variables:</p>

<ul>
<li>ID: Unique fish identifiers</li>
<li>len: Length of an individual fish</li>
<li>age: Age of an individual fish</li>
</ul>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Age-length data in 5-cm increments taken exactly from Table 2A of the source which was a sample from a hypothetical poplation in which year-class strength varied in the ratio 2:1 and the rate of increase in length decreased with age.  Actual lengths in each 5-cm interval were simulated with a uniform distribution.  The aged fish in this file were randomly selected and an assessed age was assigned according to the information in Table 2A.</p>
