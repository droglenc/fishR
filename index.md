title: We Are Moving!!
---

**fishR** is moving to a new permanent home at [fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/).

To date the [packages](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/pages/packages.html) and [data](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/pages/data_fishR_alpha.html) pages have been moved and updated (and thus deleted from here). We are in the process of **updating** and moving most of the [old blog entries](http://derekogle.com/fishR/blog/) to [here](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/blog/). The [old examples](examples/index.html) will ultimately be updated and rolled into the new blog (the books listed there are now in [a stand-alone page](https://fishr-core-team.github.io/fishR/pages/books.html)). The old [courses list](courses.html), [exposure page](exposure/index.html), and [contact page](contact.html) will ultimately be deleted.

Once everything is moved, this site will be taken down ... so please update your links to the new page.
