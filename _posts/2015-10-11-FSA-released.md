I am pleased to announce that the `FSA` (Fish Stock Assessment) package has been released on CRAN.  This package has been in development for several years, but this is the initial release on CRAN and coincides with the forthcoming [*Introductory Fisheries Analysis with R*](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/) book.  The companion `FSAdata` package, which contains only fisheries-related data, has also been released on CRAN.

* [FSAdata on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FSAdata/index.html)

For those of you that have used FSA in the past, the biggest change is that you can install `FSA` or `FSAdata` as any other package from CRAN (rather than through my special script).

These packages will be continuously updated and the most recent development versions will be available via GitHub.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Alternatively, leave issues or feature requests on the GitHub pages.
