In the last few months I have received queries about whether a “fish bioenergetics” model has been implemented in R.  Here is what I am aware of.

* [Fish Bioenergtics 4.0](https://bioenergetics4.shinyapps.io/bioenergetics4/) (an update of the Fish Bioenergetics program distributed by Wisconsin Sea Grant)
    * [an announcement](http://www.fishdata.org/newsletters/fall-2014/update-fish-bioenergetics-40-fish-bioen4), and
    * [an abstract for the upcoming AFS meeting in Portland](https://afs.confex.com/afs/2015/webprogram/Paper21117.html).
* [ISEMP (Integrated Status and Monitoring Program) implementation](http://www.isemp.org/action.php?chi=14)

If you know of others please post in the comments.
